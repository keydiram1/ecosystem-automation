# Certificate Generation

The CA certificates and keys in this directory have been pre-generated for the purpose of supporting TLS setup

Recommend, unless you have good reason not to, go leave as is.

If you do need to re-generate

Run certificates-create.sh ( to do this remove everything in this folder other than this script and the README )

Enter 4+ password as the PEM phrase - this secures the CA key ( you will need to do this twice )

You will then see

```
CA certificate not found so generating CA certificate
-----------------------------------------------------
```
Here you are setting up the CA ( Certificate Authority ). You will get the following prompts

```
Country Name (2 letter code) [UK]:
State or Province Name (full name) [London]:
Locality Name (eg, city) [London]:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Aerospike]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [Ansible Deployment]:
Common Name [aerospike_ansible_demo_cluster]:
Email Address [demo@aerospike.com]:
```

Accept defaults for country name,state, locality, org name, unit name ( not that it matters too much ), email. You can set the common name to whatever you like, first time.

Next you will see
```
Removing certificates previously signed

Server certificates not found - generating
------------------------------------------
```
Here you are generating the server certificate, and getting it signed by the CA you just generated. You will get the following prompts
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [UK]:
State or Province Name (full name) [London]:
Locality Name (eg, city) [London]:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Aerospike]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) [Ansible Deployment]:
Common Name [aerospike_ansible_demo_cluster]:
Email Address [demo@aerospike.com]:
```
Again, it doesn't matter too much what you choose, except the common name should be the same as the tls_name parameter in group_vars/all.yml - otherwise the crypto will not work.

You will be prompted for the pass-phrase you entered above

Answer y to 'Sign the Certificate'

Answer y to '1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit'
